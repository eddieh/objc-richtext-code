0.1.5   * finish up AFM parsing and PS rendering code, which works now 
          in such a way that it could be fairly easily extended to e.g. PCL6
          perhaps (by implementing a PCL6Fontchange attribute object)

0.1.4   * intermediate release (not everything of 0.1.3 is implemented yet)

0.1.3   * add Changes file

        * changed name of program from richtext to rt

	* implemented File->Revert to Saved

	* handle WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol (for WM close button) 

	* set XtExposeCompressSeries for coalescing expose events
          (doesnt seem to make any difference to me)

	* fix bug with wrong font properties for newly inserted text

	* fix bug in zapSelection (add method attributesAtBlock: to richtext)

	* implemented File->Print, which converts RTF to PS

          this required addition of a set of AFM files, which I downloaded
          from:

	    ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/type/mac/all/afmfiles/TypeBasics/

          and recoded to Unix/NL files using GNU recode mac..latin1

	* added lexical analyzer for AFM files.  

          Note: this requires flex because it uses exclusive start states
          and the -P option (we have now 2 analyzers in the same program)
